# K6 Performance Dashboard 📊

This branch (`gh-pages`) hosts the **Performance Dashboard Website** for the Load Testing Framework.

## 🏢 Business Flow (Alur Kerja)

This dashboard is the final visualization layer of our Automated Performance Testing pipeline.

1.  **Trigger**: Engineer triggers "K6 Load Test" or "Run All" in GitHub Actions.
2.  **Execution**: System simulates up to 30-500 VUs hitting the Petstore API.
3.  **Data Processing**: 
    - Test results (Pass/Fail, Latency) are converted to JSON.
    - Historical data is fetched from this branch (`history.json`).
    - New results are appended to history.
4.  **Deployment**: 
    - This static website (React App) is rebuilt with the new data.
    - The result is pushed automatically to this `gh-pages` branch.

## 📂 Data Structure
- `data/latest.json`: Results from the most recent run (displayed on initial load).
- `data/history.json`: Consolidated history of last 50 runs (used for Trend Charts).
- `index.html`: The entry point for the React Application.

> **Note:** Do not manually edit files in this branch. They are auto-generated by the CI/CD pipeline.
